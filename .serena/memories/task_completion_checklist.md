# Task Completion Checklist for Transire

## Design Phase Tasks

Since this is currently a design-only repository, task completion focuses on design consistency and quality:

### Design Document Tasks
- [ ] Verify alignment between DESIGN.md and DESIGN_PROMPT.md
- [ ] Ensure examples match design specifications
- [ ] Check for scope creep (stay focused on MVP)
- [ ] Validate technical feasibility of proposed architecture
- [ ] Ensure clear separation of concerns

### Documentation Tasks  
- [ ] Review README.md for accuracy and completeness
- [ ] Check that code examples compile and make sense
- [ ] Verify all referenced files exist
- [ ] Ensure design documents are internally consistent

### Architecture Review Tasks
- [ ] Validate interface definitions match intended use cases
- [ ] Check that abstractions don't leak cloud-specific details
- [ ] Ensure extensibility for future providers/languages
- [ ] Review for potential implementation challenges

### Quality Checks
- [ ] No broken links or references
- [ ] Consistent terminology throughout documents
- [ ] Examples demonstrate real-world usage patterns
- [ ] Clear distinction between MVP and future features

## Future Implementation Tasks (When Code Exists)
- Testing (unit, integration)
- Linting and formatting
- Security review
- Performance considerations
- Documentation generation

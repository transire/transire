# CLA Signatures

This directory contains the CLA signatures for the Transire project.

- `cla.json` - Contains the list of GitHub usernames who have signed the CLA
- This file is automatically managed by the CLA GitHub Action
- Do not manually edit the cla.json file

## How it works

When a contributor:
1. Opens a pull request
2. Signs the CLA by commenting "I have read the CLA Document and I hereby sign the CLA"
3. Their GitHub username is automatically added to the cla.json file
4. Future pull requests from that contributor are automatically approved for CLA compliance
